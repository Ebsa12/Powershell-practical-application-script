# Powershell-practical-application-script

This PowerShell script is designed as a simple interactive menu system that is tailored to users named "Ebsa". Upon running the script, it prompts the user to input their first name. If the first name entered is "Ebsa", the script grants access to a specialized menu with several options:

Display the version of PowerShell: When selected, this option displays the current version of PowerShell being used, including details such as the PS version, CLR version, and more.
Create a new folder: This allows the user to specify a name for a new folder, which will be created within the C:\temp\ directory.
Create a new file: Similar to folder creation, this option lets the user name a new file to be created in the C:\temp\ directory.
Print the 5 most recent entries in the PowerShell Event log: This option fetches and displays the latest five entries from the System event log, which can be helpful for troubleshooting or monitoring system events.
Exit the menu system: This terminates the interaction and closes the menu system.
For users not named "Ebsa", the script will deny access and display a message indicating that they are not authorized to use the system.

I learn a multitude of skills and concepts that are valuable across many aspects of IT, especially in areas related to automation, system administration, and scripting.
